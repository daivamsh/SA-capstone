This report details the design, implementation, and justification of a dynamic pricing engine for urban parking lots, using only Python, pandas, numpy, and Pathway, as required by the project guidelines. The report covers the data preparation, feature engineering, three pricing models (baseline, demand-based, competitive), and the logic behind each step. It also explains the demand function, key assumptions, and how price changes are governed by demand and competition.
